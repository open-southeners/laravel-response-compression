Laravel Response Compression [![required php version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/php-v/open-southeners/laravel-response-compression)](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/open-southeners/laravel-response-compression/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=Q31AYXXGOA)](https://codecov.io/gh/open-southeners/laravel-response-compression) [![Edit on VSCode online](https://img.shields.io/badge/vscode-edit%20online-blue?logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/github/open-southeners/laravel-response-compression)
===

Add server-side response compression to Laravel with a range of different algorithms (Gzip, brotli, deflate...)

## Why use this package?

The reason why is because AWS **hard limit its API Gateway** service to 10MB (at the date of writing this), and by hard we mean that there's no way you can increase this limitation.

**Note: Thought CloudFlare is a good solution for the end user, it doesn't solve this issue as CloudFlare does this between the server and the client, so the response already passed through AWS (API Gateway).**

Or on our blog article: https://opensoutheners.com/how-to-prevent-large-responses-to-trigger-502-errors

## Getting started

```bash
composer require open-southeners/laravel-vapor-response-compression
```

Then publish the configuration file defaults into your application's config folder:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=response-compression
```

Then add the following to you `app/Http/Kernel.php` as a global middleware:

**Note: Remember this is different in older versions of Laravel, Laravel 9 should look like the following.**

```php
/**
 * The application's global HTTP middleware stack.
 *
 * These middleware are run during every request to your application.
 *
 * @var array<string, array<int, class-string|string>>
 */
protected $middleware = [
    // ...
    \OpenSoutheners\LaravelResponseCompression\ResponseCompression::class,
];
```

### Configuration

If you already have this `config/response-compression.php` file, you can skip this step, otherwise please use the following artisan command first:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=response-compression
```

**Note: As for smaller responses this threshold will prevent to compress the response if it doesn't reach an specific number of bytes. We encourage you to configure this and not leave it as ±0 bytes otherwise response will be always compressed.**

This configuration is **defaulted to 10000 bytes**, you may customise this as your application demands.

### Setting up Brotli and/or ZStandard extensions in Vapor

First of all, **this will require you to use Docker containers on your Vapor environments** if you're not familiar with them, you can still use this extension as **it uses the first client requested algorithm available at server side**.

👉 [Read more about using containers in Vapor here](https://docs.vapor.build/projects/environments#docker-runtimes)

#### Brotli
Anyway, in case you want to proceed, add this to your environment Dockerfile(s), **please use comments as references only**:

```Dockerfile
# FROM laravelphp/vapor:php84

RUN apk add --no-cache brotli

# COPY . /var/task
```

And ensure your project depends on [vdechenaux/brotli](https://github.com/vdechenaux/brotli-php).

### Alternative Brotli setup

Another alternative is to use: https://github.com/kjdev/php-ext-brotli

```sh
pecl install brotli
```

```Dockerfile
# FROM laravelphp/vapor:php84

RUN pecl install brotli \
    && docker-php-ext-enable brotli \

# COPY . /var/task
```

#### ZStandard

Using https://github.com/kjdev/php-ext-zstd

```sh
pecl install zstd
```

```Dockerfile
# FROM laravelphp/vapor:php84

RUN pecl install zstd  \
    && docker-php-ext-enable zstd \

# COPY . /var/task
```

#### Lz4

Using https://github.com/kjdev/php-ext-lz4

**Note: Only Debian or RHEL packages here, Vapor uses Alpine as base images so no luck here...**

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php-lz4
```
